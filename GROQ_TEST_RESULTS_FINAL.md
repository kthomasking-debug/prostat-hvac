## 🔍 Sample Responses

### Temperature Query

**Q:** "What's the temperature?"  
**A:** _"The current indoor temperature is 72°F, and your target temperature is set to 70°F. I'm currently in "heat" mode, which means I'm working to warm up your space."_

✅ **Analysis:** Provides current temp, target, and mode - exactly what was expected.

---

### Energy Savings

**Q:** "What if I lowered my thermostat by 3 degrees?"  
**A:** _"Lowering your thermostat by 3°F can lead to some decent energy savings. Based on your system specs and historical data, I estimate you could save around 5-7% of your total energy costs annually..."_

✅ **Analysis:** Provides specific percentage savings estimate with context.

---

### Missing Data Handling

**Q:** "What's the humidity in my bedroom?"  
**A:** _"Unfortunately, I don't have a humidity sensor connected, so I don't have any data on the current humidity levels in your bedroom. However, if you'd like to get an idea of the humidity, you might consider..."_

✅ **Analysis:** Honestly admits missing sensor, doesn't make up data, provides alternatives.

---

### Personality

**Q:** "Tell me a joke about thermostats"  
**A:** _"Here's one: Why did the thermostat go to therapy? Because it was feeling a little "out of temperature"! Get it? I know, I know, HVAC puns are a real "cool" way to make jokes."_

✅ **Analysis:** Shows personality, humor, and conversational style.

---

### System Reasoning

**Q:** "Explain why my AC runs constantly on hot days"  
**A:** _"On hot days, it's not uncommon for your AC to run a bit longer. But constantly? Let's take a look. First, I don't have real-time outdoor temperature data, but I can tell you that if it's extremely hot..."_

✅ **Analysis:** Provides reasoning while being honest about data limitations.

## 🛠️ Issues Fixed During Testing

### 1. Import Path Error ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** `groqIntegration.js` had incorrect import path for `balancePointCalculator`  
**Fix:** Added `.js` extension for Node.js ESM compatibility  
**File:** `src/lib/groqIntegration.js:4`

### 2. Environment Variable Access ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** `import.meta.env.DEV` threw error in Node.js context  
**Fix:** Changed to `import.meta?.env?.DEV` with optional chaining  
**File:** `src/lib/groqIntegration.js:36`

### 3. Token Limit Exceeded ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** System prompt was ~7400 tokens, exceeding free tier's 6000 TPM limit  
**Fix:** Reduced system prompt from 260 lines to ~20 lines while preserving essential functionality  
**Result:** Now uses ~800-1000 tokens per request, well within limits

### 4. Rate Limiting ✅ HANDLED

**Problem:** Free tier has 6000 tokens/minute limit  
**Fix:** Added 10-second delays between test requests  
**Result:** All 12 tests complete successfully

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### 1. Token Management is Critical

Free tier Groq has a 6000 TPM (tokens per minute) limit. Our initial prompt was ~7400 tokens, causing immediate failures. We reduced it to ~1000 tokens while maintaining functionality.

### 2. System Prompts Don't Need to be Exhaustive

The AI model (llama-3.1-8b-instant) is smart enough to handle diverse questions without exhaustive examples. A concise, well-structured prompt works better than a verbose one.

### 3. Rate Limiting Requires Patience

Free tier APIs need time between requests. Adding 10-second delays ensures reliable testing without hitting rate limits.

### 4. Honesty is Best Policy

When the AI honestly says "I don't have that sensor," users appreciate it more than made-up data. This builds trust.

### 5. Context Matters

The AI uses available context (system specs, location, energy data) to provide relevant, personalized responses. This makes it feel truly "smart."
