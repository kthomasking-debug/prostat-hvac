## IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

**Warning:** This device controls 120 V–240 V equipment. Improper installation may result in fire, electric shock, or the sudden appearance of St. Nicholas asking why you touched the wires without turning off the breaker.

Installation must be performed by a competent adult or under direct supervision of a licensed HVAC technician who has been blessed with holy oil.

## In the box

- 1 × 7" Android tablet (the visible icon of the system)
- 1 × Wall-mount bracket with 360° rotation (for proper veneration angle)
- 1 × 8-channel USB relay module
- 1 × 24 VAC → 12 VDC converter
- 1 × 24 VAC → 5 VDC USB converter
- 1 × 40–100 A contactor (the one that goes CLUNK)
- Assorted wire nuts, screws, and a tiny vial of myrrh (for anointing the contactor on Pascha)

---

## Tools required

- Phillips screwdriver
- Wire stripper
- Voltage tester (non-contact preferred—do not tempt the Lord thy God)
- Level (optional, but pleasing to the eye)

---

## Step 1 – Turn off power

Locate your HVAC circuit breaker. Turn it OFF. Verify with voltage tester.

If the breaker is labeled "FURNACE" or "AIR HANDLER," you are in the right place.

Pray the Jesus Prayer three times for good measure.

---

## Step 2 – Remove old thermostat

Take a photo of the existing wiring. Send it to your group chat titled "please tell me if this will burn the house down."

---

## Step 3 – Mount the wall bracket

Hold bracket against wall at approximately icon height (54–60" from floor).

Mark holes. Drill. Insert anchors. Screw bracket.

Ensure tablet will face the nave (east is preferred).

---

## Step 4 – Wire the contactor (the CLUNK unit)

- L1 & L2 from breaker → contactor line side
- Load side → your heat pump / dehumidifier / future electric ark of the covenant
- A1 & A2 coil terminals → N.O. contacts of relay channel 1

(Refer to diagram on page 2. If you hear buzzing instead of CLUNK, you have wired it wrong. Repent and try again.)

---

## Step 5 – Power the brain

- Connect 24 VAC transformer wires to C and Rc/Rh (it doesn't matter—both go to the converters)
- 24 VAC → 12 VDC converter → red/black to relay VCC/GND
- 24 VAC → 5 VDC converter → USB-C cable → tablet (always charging)

---

## Step 6 – Connect USB relay

Plug USB-A end into tablet.

Open the St. Thermostat app → Settings → Relay Test → press "CLUNK" button.

You should hear a satisfying mechanical clunk and see the contactor close.

If not, check jumper is set to 12 V coil position.

---

## Step 7 – Final checkout

1. Restore power at breaker
2. Tablet should boot to the chanting interface
3. Set temperature to 71 °F
4. Verify the system runs and the electric bill begins its descent toward $420 salvation

---

## Troubleshooting

- **"No CLUNK"** → check 12 V coil jumper and wiring
- **"Tablet dead"** → confirm 5 V converter is warm but not on fire
- **"Too cold in church"** → lower setpoint or increase insulation. Do not adjust above 71 °F or the thermostat will gently remind you in Tone 5.

---

## Warranty

One (1) year or until Bright Week, whichever comes first.

Warranty void if used to summon demons or if the contactor is not anointed annually.

## Support

---

## Rejoice, O Coil Unfrosted!

Through the prayers of the Holy HVAC Technicians, O Lord Jesus Christ our God, have mercy on us and save our utility bills. Amen.

_Your godfather will read it, snort once, and then quietly install ten of them in every church he services._

_Let the clunking begin._
