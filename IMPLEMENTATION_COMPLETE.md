# Agent Enhancements - Implementation Complete ✅

## 🎉 What Was Implemented

I've integrated **Phase 1 Quick Wins** into your existing AskJoule system:

### ✅ 1. Conversation Memory

- **Location:** `src/lib/agentEnhancementsBrowser.js` → `ConversationMemory` class
- **Integration:** `src/lib/groqAgent.js` → `answerWithAgent()` now uses memory
- **How it works:**
  - Saves every Q&A to localStorage
  - Retrieves relevant past conversations (keyword matching)
  - Feeds context to LLM for better answers
  - Remembers up to 50 conversations

**User sees:**

- Agent remembers what they asked before
- Follows up on previous issues
- Builds on past conversations

---

### ✅ 2. Proactive Alerts

- **Location:** `src/lib/agentEnhancementsBrowser.js` → `ProactiveAlerts` class
- **Integration:** `src/hooks/useProactiveAgent.js` → React hook
- **Integration:** `src/components/AskJoule.jsx` → Shows alerts in UI
- **How it works:**
  - Checks system health every hour
  - Detects: aux heat overuse, temperature drift, short cycling
  - Shows alerts in AskJoule component
  - User can dismiss alerts

**User sees:**

- ⚠️ Alert banner when issues detected
- "Auxiliary heat has run for 2 hours - unusual!"
- "Temperature is 4°F away from setpoint"
- Agent catches problems before they ask

---

### ✅ 3. Daily Briefings

- **Location:** `src/lib/agentEnhancementsBrowser.js` → `DailyBriefing` class
- **Integration:** `src/hooks/useProactiveAgent.js` → Auto-generates in morning
- **Integration:** `src/components/AskJoule.jsx` → Shows briefing in UI
- **How it works:**
  - Checks if it's 7-9 AM
  - Generates summary of yesterday's usage
  - Shows system health, weather, recommendations
  - Only shows once per day

**User sees:**

- 📊 Daily briefing banner in morning
- "Yesterday: 12 kWh, $1.80"
- System health status
- Recommendations for savings

## 🎯 How It Works

### Conversation Memory Flow:

```
User: "Why did aux heat come on?"
  ↓
Agent: Checks conversation history
  ↓
Finds: "Last week you asked about aux heat..."
  ↓
Agent: "Based on our earlier conversation about aux heat thresholds..."
```

### Proactive Alerts Flow:

```
Every hour:
  ↓
Agent checks: aux heat usage, temp drift, patterns
  ↓
If issue found:
  ↓
Shows alert banner in AskJoule
  ↓
User sees: "⚠️ Aux heat ran 2 hours - unusual!"
```

### Daily Briefing Flow:

```
7-9 AM:
  ↓
Agent generates briefing
  ↓
Shows: Energy usage, system health, recommendations
  ↓
User sees: "📊 Daily Briefing: Yesterday 12 kWh, $1.80..."
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Conversation Memory

**Automatic** - Works behind the scenes. Agent remembers past conversations automatically.

### Proactive Alerts

**Automatic** - Checks every hour. Alerts appear in AskJoule component when issues detected.

**Manual check:**

```javascript
const { checkAlerts } = useProactiveAgent();
await checkAlerts();
```

### Daily Briefing

**Automatic** - Shows in morning (7-9 AM) once per day.

**Manual trigger:**

```javascript
const { getBriefing } = useProactiveAgent();
const message = await getBriefing();
```

## ✅ Testing

### Test Conversation Memory:

1. Ask: "Why did aux heat come on?"
2. Ask: "How can I prevent that?"
3. Agent should reference first question

### Test Proactive Alerts:

1. Set aux heat runtime > 120 minutes (in localStorage)
2. Wait for hourly check (or trigger manually)
3. Should see alert banner

### Test Daily Briefing:

1. Set time to 7-9 AM (or trigger manually)
2. Should see briefing banner
3. Should only show once per day

- Works in browser environment
- No server required

### Data Sources

- Reads from `localStorage` (thermostat data, settings)
- Falls back gracefully if data missing
- No errors if sensors unavailable

### Performance

- Memory: Stores last 50 conversations
- Alerts: Checks every hour (lightweight)
- Briefing: Generates once per day
