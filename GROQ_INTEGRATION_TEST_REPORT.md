## 🔍 What to Verify

When testing with a live API key, verify that the AI:

### ✅ Answers New Questions Correctly

- [ ] Responds to temperature queries with relevant information
- [ ] Handles energy savings questions with practical advice
- [ ] Explains system behavior clearly
- [ ] Admits when it doesn't have data (humidity, room sensors)
- [ ] Shows personality for fun questions

### ✅ Uses Context Appropriately

- [ ] References user's actual system specs (HSPF, SEER)
- [ ] Uses location data for weather-related answers
- [ ] Incorporates thermostat data when available
- [ ] Considers energy costs in savings calculations

### ✅ Handles Edge Cases

- [ ] Missing API key → Shows setup message
- [ ] API errors → User-friendly error messages
- [ ] Missing data → Honest "I don't have that sensor" responses
- [ ] Ambiguous questions → Asks for clarification or makes reasonable assumptions

### ✅ Response Quality

- [ ] Responses are conversational and natural
- [ ] Not too verbose (under 200 words typically)
- [ ] Factually accurate about HVAC concepts
- [ ] Maintains "Joule" personality (helpful, sometimes witty)
