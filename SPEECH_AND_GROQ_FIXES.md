# 🐛 Bug Fixes - Speech Synthesis Toggle & Groq Auto-Send

## ✅ Bug 1: Speech Synthesis Toggle Not Working

### **Issue**

**File:** `src/hooks/useSpeechSynthesis.js` lines 212-267

**Problem:**

- The `speak` function only checked `enabledRef.current` (parent's `enabled` prop)
- It ignored the internal `isEnabled` state that's toggled by `toggleEnabled`
- When users clicked the toggle button, `isEnabled` changed but `speak` didn't respect it
- The dependency array was missing `isEnabled`, so the function didn't update when toggled

**Original (Broken) Code:**

```javascript
const speak = useCallback(
  (text, options = {}) => {
    // Only checked enabledRef.current, not isEnabled
    if (!isSupported || !enabledRef.current || !text) return;
    // ... rest of function
  },
  [isSupported, voice] // Missing isEnabled dependency
);
```

**Fixed:**

```javascript
const speak = useCallback(
  (text, options = {}) => {
    // Check BOTH parent prop AND internal state
    if (!isSupported || !enabledRef.current || !isEnabled || !text) return;
    // ... rest of function
  },
  [isSupported, voice, isEnabled] // Added isEnabled to dependencies
);
```

**Explanation:**

- Now checks **both** `enabledRef.current` (parent control) **AND** `isEnabled` (internal toggle)
- Both must be `true` for speech to work
- Added `isEnabled` to dependency array so function updates when toggled
- `toggleEnabled` now works correctly

## ✅ Bug 2: Automatic Groq API Calls Without User Confirmation

### **Issue**

**File:** `src/components/AskJoule.jsx` lines 1805-1810

**Problem:**

- When `aiMode` was enabled and a question was unparseable, the code automatically sent it to Groq
- This happened **without user confirmation**
- Users weren't aware API calls were being made
- Consumed API quota silently
- Created jarring UX where unexpected network requests occurred

**Original (Problematic) Code:**

```javascript
if (!hasAny) {
  // If AI Mode is enabled and Groq API key is present, automatically use Groq
  if (groqApiKey && aiMode) {
    fetchGroqLLM(value); // ❌ Auto-sends without confirmation
    return;
  }
  // Otherwise, if Groq API key is present, prompt user for LLM fallback
  if (groqApiKey) {
    setShowGroqPrompt(true);
    return;
  }
  // ...
}
```

**Fixed:**

```javascript
if (!hasAny) {
  // Always prompt user before sending to Groq (even if aiMode is enabled)
  // This prevents unexpected API calls and quota consumption
  if (groqApiKey) {
    setShowGroqPrompt(true); // ✅ Always prompt first
    return;
  }
  // ...
}
```

**Explanation:**

- Removed the automatic `fetchGroqLLM(value)` call when `aiMode` is enabled
- Now **always prompts the user** before sending to Groq
- Users have control over when API calls are made
- Prevents unexpected quota consumption
- Better UX - users know what's happening

## 🧪 Verification

### **Bug 1 Verification**

| Action              | Before                      | After                            |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Click toggle button | ❌ No effect (still speaks) | ✅ Speech stops/starts correctly |
| Toggle off          | ❌ Still speaks             | ✅ Speech blocked                |
| Toggle on           | ❌ Already speaking         | ✅ Speech enabled                |
| Parent disables     | ✅ Speech blocked           | ✅ Speech blocked (both checks)  |

### **Bug 2 Verification**

| Scenario                            | Before                | After                 |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| `aiMode = true`, unparseable query  | ❌ Auto-sends to Groq | ✅ Prompts user first |
| `aiMode = false`, unparseable query | ✅ Prompts user       | ✅ Prompts user       |
| User confirms prompt                | ✅ Sends to Groq      | ✅ Sends to Groq      |
| User cancels prompt                 | ✅ No API call        | ✅ No API call        |

## 📝 Files Modified

1. **`src/hooks/useSpeechSynthesis.js`**

   - Line 215: Added `!isEnabled` check to `speak` function
   - Line 267: Added `isEnabled` to dependency array
   - Now respects both parent prop and internal toggle state

2. **`src/components/AskJoule.jsx`**
   - Lines 1806-1810: Removed automatic Groq call when `aiMode` is enabled
   - Now always prompts user before sending to Groq
   - Better UX and prevents unexpected API calls

## ✅ Impact

### **Bug 1 Impact:**

- **Before:** Toggle button didn't work - speech continued even when toggled off
- **After:** Toggle button works correctly - respects both parent and internal state
- **Result:** Users can now control speech synthesis properly

### **Bug 2 Impact:**

- **Before:** Silent API calls when `aiMode` enabled, unexpected quota consumption
- **After:** Always prompts user, no surprise API calls
- **Result:** Better UX, users have control, no unexpected costs

## 🎯 Summary

Both bugs have been **verified and fixed**:

✅ **Speech toggle** - Now checks both parent prop and internal state  
✅ **Groq auto-send** - Always prompts user before API calls

The fixes are minimal, targeted, and maintain backward compatibility while correcting the logical errors.
