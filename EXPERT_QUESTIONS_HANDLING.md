# Expert Diagnostic Questions - Agent Handling

## ✅ What Was Added

### 1. Enhanced "I Don't Know" Responses

The agent now **explains WHY** it doesn't have data:

**Before:**

- ❌ "I don't know"
- ❌ "I don't have that data"

**After:**

- ✅ "I don't have a supply air temperature sensor installed. That requires a sensor placed in the ductwork near the air handler, which isn't part of standard thermostat installations."
- ✅ "I don't have real-time power monitoring for the auxiliary heat strips. That would require a current clamp or power meter installed on the strip heat circuit."

### 2. New Knowledge Base Files

Added 5 new knowledge files covering expert topics:

- ✅ `diagnostic_sensors.md` - What sensors are/aren't available, how to explain missing data
- ✅ `aux_heat_diagnostics.md` - Advanced aux heat questions (lockout, thresholds, runtime)
- ✅ `thermostat_settings.md` - Ecobee-specific settings (staging, recovery, balance mode)
- ✅ `cold_weather_performance.md` - Performance metrics, COP, heating rates
- ✅ `rapid_testing.md` - Will strips trigger? Safe temperature steps?

### 3. New Tool: `getDiagnosticData()`

Checks what sensors are available vs missing for diagnostic questions:

```javascript
getDiagnosticData(
  "What's the supply air temperature?",
  thermostatData,
  userSettings
);
// Returns:
// {
//   available: ['indoorTemp', 'targetTemp', 'mode'],
//   missing: ['supplyAirTemp', 'returnAirTemp'],
//   explanation: "Missing sensors: supplyAirTemp, returnAirTemp. These require specialized sensors..."
// }
```

### 4. Enhanced RAG Search

Now automatically fetches relevant knowledge for expert questions:

- "supply air" → `diagnostic_sensors.md`
- "lockout" → `aux_heat_diagnostics.md`
- "setting" → `thermostat_settings.md`
- "recovery" → `rapid_testing.md`
- "cold weather" → `cold_weather_performance.md`
