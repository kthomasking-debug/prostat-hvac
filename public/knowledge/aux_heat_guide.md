# Auxiliary Heat Guide

## What is Auxiliary Heat?

Electric resistance strips that supplement the heat pump when it can't keep up alone. Also called "strip heat" or "emergency heat."

## When Aux Heat Activates

1. **Outdoor temperature below balance point** (typically 25-35°F)
2. **Large temperature setback recovery** (>3°F difference)
3. **Defrost cycle** (temporary, 5-10 minutes)
4. **Manual emergency heat mode**

## Cost Impact

- Heat pump: ~3-4 kW ($0.45-0.60/hour at $0.15/kWh)
- Aux heat: ~10-15 kW ($1.50-2.25/hour at $0.15/kWh)
- **Aux heat costs 3-4x more per hour**

## How to Minimize Aux Heat Usage

### Temperature Setbacks

- ✅ **Use small setbacks:** 1-2°F maximum
- ❌ **Avoid large setbacks:** 3+°F triggers strips during recovery
- ✅ **Example:** 70°F day, 68°F night (2°F setback)

### Recovery Time

- Heat pumps need 1.5-2 hours for recovery
- Gas furnaces need only 30-60 minutes
- Allow longer recovery windows to avoid triggering aux

### Adaptive Recovery

- Enable if available in thermostat settings
- System learns recovery time and starts early
- Reduces aux heat activation

### Temperature Delta Triggers

- Most systems trigger aux at 2-3°F temperature difference
- Smaller setbacks = less aux heat usage
- Steady temperature may be more cost-effective than large setbacks

## Balance Point

The outdoor temperature where heat pump alone can't maintain comfort:

- Typical range: 25-35°F
- Varies by system capacity and home insulation
- Below this point, aux heat is needed

## Recommendations

1. Set thermostat for small, gradual changes
2. Avoid "emergency heat" mode unless necessary
3. Use adaptive recovery if available
4. Consider dual-fuel (gas + heat pump) in very cold climates
5. Maintain steady temperatures in extreme cold
