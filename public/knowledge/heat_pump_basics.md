# Heat Pump Basics

## How Heat Pumps Work

Heat pumps move heat rather than create it. They extract heat from outdoor air (even cold air) and move it indoors during winter, and reverse the process for cooling.

## Key Characteristics

- **Discharge air temperature:** 90-110°F (feels lukewarm, not hot like gas furnace)
- **Heating rate:** 1-2°F per hour (slower than gas furnaces at 3-5°F/hour)
- **Runtime:** Designed for long operation (12-16 hours/day in cold weather is NORMAL)
- **Balance point:** Temperature where aux heat is needed (typically 25-35°F)

## Common Misconceptions

1. **"It's heating slowly"** → This is NORMAL behavior
2. **"Air feels lukewarm"** → Heat pumps don't blast hot air like gas furnaces
3. **"Running all the time"** → Designed for continuous operation, not cycling
4. **"Something's broken"** → Often it's just defrost cycle or normal operation

## Efficiency

- Most efficient at 40-50°F outdoor temperature
- Efficiency drops as outdoor temperature decreases
- HSPF2 rating indicates heating efficiency (higher is better)
- SEER2 rating indicates cooling efficiency

## When to Use Auxiliary Heat

Aux heat (electric resistance) should activate:

- Below balance point (outdoor temp < 25-35°F)
- During large temperature recoveries (>3°F setback)
- During defrost cycle (temporary)

**Cost:** Aux heat is 2-3x more expensive than heat pump compressor.
