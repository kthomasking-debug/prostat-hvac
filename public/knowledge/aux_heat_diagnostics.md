# Auxiliary Heat Diagnostics

## Advanced Aux Heat Questions

### What Causes Aux Heat to Activate?

Auxiliary heat (strip heat) activates when:

1. **Outdoor temperature below balance point**

   - Typically 25-35°F depending on system
   - Heat pump alone can't maintain comfort

2. **Large temperature setback recovery**

   - Setback > 3°F often triggers strips
   - System uses strips for faster recovery

3. **Defrost cycle**

   - Temporary activation during defrost
   - Lasts 5-10 minutes

4. **Manual emergency heat mode**
   - User forces aux heat only
   - Bypasses heat pump

### Lockout Settings

**Aux Heat Max Outdoor Temp:**

- Prevents aux heat above this temperature
- Typical: 30-40°F
- Protects against unnecessary strip usage

**Aux Heat Min Outdoor Temp:**

- Allows aux heat below this temperature
- Typical: 15-25°F
- Ensures comfort in extreme cold

**Aux Heat Threshold:**

- Temperature delta that triggers strips
- Typical: 2-3°F difference
- Varies by thermostat model

**Compressor to Aux Temperature Delta:**

- How much temp difference before aux activates
- Typical: 2-3°F
- Some systems: 1.5-2°F

### Runtime Monitoring

**How long were strips active today?**

- Requires runtime logging (not always available)
- Can estimate from energy usage if available
- Typical: 0-4 hours depending on weather

**Percentage of heating from strips vs heat pump:**

- Requires separate runtime tracking for each
- Can estimate from energy costs if available
- Goal: <20% from strips in moderate climates

### Recovery Behavior

**Did thermostat recovery cause strips?**

- Large setbacks (>3°F) often trigger strips
- Small setbacks (1-2°F) usually don't
- Adaptive recovery can help prevent this

**Would turning adaptive recovery off prevent strip activation?**

- Possibly, but may reduce comfort
- Adaptive recovery starts early to avoid strips
- Without it, system may need strips for faster recovery

### Cost Impact

**Real-time watt draw:**

- Typical: 10-15 kW when active
- Costs 3-4x more than heat pump per hour
- Requires power meter to measure directly

**Maximum runtime per hour:**

- Some systems limit to prevent overheating
- Typical: 15-20 minutes per hour max
- Check thermostat settings for limit
