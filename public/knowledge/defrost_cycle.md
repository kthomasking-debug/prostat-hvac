# Defrost Cycle Guide

## What is Defrost Mode?

Heat pumps temporarily reverse to AC mode to melt ice buildup on the outdoor coil. This is **NORMAL** and automatic.

## Why It Happens

- Ice forms on outdoor coil during heating in cold, humid conditions
- Ice reduces efficiency and airflow
- System must periodically melt the ice

## What You'll Notice

1. **Steam/vapor from outdoor unit** → Ice melting (normal)
2. **System switches to "cooling" briefly** → Reversing valve activates
3. **Indoor fan may blow cool air** → Some systems do this, others don't
4. **Lasts 5-10 minutes** → Automatic, no intervention needed
5. **Aux heat may activate** → To maintain indoor comfort during defrost

## Frequency

- **Normal:** Every 30-90 minutes in cold, humid weather
- **More frequent:** Freezing rain, fog, heavy humidity
- **Less frequent:** Dry cold weather
- **Too frequent:** Every 20-30 minutes or less (indicates problem)

## Signs of Defrost Problems

- ❌ Defrosting every 15-20 minutes or continuously
- ❌ Heavy ice buildup that doesn't clear
- ❌ Poor heating performance
- ❌ High energy bills

## Causes of Excessive Defrost

1. **Dirty outdoor coil** → Needs cleaning
2. **Low refrigerant** → Needs HVAC service
3. **Faulty defrost sensor** → Needs replacement
4. **Blocked airflow** → Clear debris around outdoor unit

## What's Normal vs Abnormal

### ✅ Normal

- Light frost on coil between defrost cycles
- Defrost every 30-90 minutes in cold weather
- Steam/water during defrost
- Brief cool air indoors (5-10 min)

### ❌ Abnormal

- Continuous defrosting
- Heavy ice that doesn't melt
- Defrost cycle > 15 minutes
- Indoor temperature drop > 2°F during defrost

## User Actions

**Normal defrost:** No action needed - it's automatic and by design

**Excessive defrost:**

1. Check outdoor unit for debris
2. Inspect coil for dirt/blockage
3. Call HVAC tech if problem persists

## Common Misconception

**"My heat pump is broken - it's blowing cold air in winter!"**
→ Most likely defrost cycle, which is **NORMAL**. If it lasts < 10 minutes and happens every 30-90 minutes, the system is working correctly.
